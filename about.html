<b>Madeline Weisenburger</b>
     <br> <br>
"I once ate a Mars Bar on the side of a highway"
     <br> <br>

As a young child, Madeline knew exactly what she was born to do; sell exclusive and luxurious
              <br>
              
            pens and be apart of the most infamous scandal that the pen industry has ever seen. 
              <br>
              She was born in 1935, on a quaint farm in east Illinois. Her parents were German <br>
              immigrants, given this farming land by the government to grow “carrots’’. For the <br>
              first 17 years of her life she endured strenuous labor in the fields, which built <br>
              character and showed her what hard work really meant. When she turned 18, she left <br>
              her family and her small town life for the big city; Cornborough City, North
              <br>
              Dakota.

              <b>Fiona Gray</b>
              <br><br>
              "Submarines weren't there"
              <br><br>
              



              
              Fiona, as a young child, always had the wildest imagination, which followed her throughout her
              <br>
              adult life. Fiona had a surprising turning point in her life, she suddenly had a grand dream to 
              <br>
             become the first American astronaut to eat a doughnut in space; you could say it was a far-out
              <br>
             dream. Though the wide public was not aware that we were capable of space travel yet, Fiona knew
              <br>
              and was determined to follow through on her dream. She contacted the then very very secret
              <br>
              government operation of NASA and accomplished her aspiration of eating that moist, rainbow 
              <br>
              sprinkle covered doughnut in the great beyond. Contrary to popular belief Fiona Gray was the
              <br>
              first person in space, not Yuri Gagarin.
